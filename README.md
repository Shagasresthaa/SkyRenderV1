# SkyRenderV1
SkyRender V1 is a real-time skymap application visualizing radio sources. Initially using public data sources for prototyping stage, it provides dynamic observations of the night sky. Future updates and final updates will enable direct data collection with custom radio equipment for enhanced real-time rendering and processing of radio signals.
