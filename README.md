# SkyRenderV1
SkyRender V1 is a real-time skymap application visualizing radio sources. Initially using public data from CHIME and LOFAR, it provides dynamic observations of the night sky. Future updates will enable direct data collection with custom radio equipment for enhanced real-time rendering and signal processing.
