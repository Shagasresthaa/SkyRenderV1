# SkyRenderV1: A Real-Time Skymap Application Visualizing Radio Sources

## Introduction

SkyRenderV1 is a real-time skymap application designed to visualize radio sources using multi-wavelength data. The application leverages public data sources for real-time data initially and aims to integrate hardware for direct observations in the future.

## Features

- Real-time data fetching from public sources
- Visualization of radio sources on a skymap
- Dynamic updates of Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) ranges
- Modular architecture for easy extension and integration with hardware components

## Getting Started

To get started with SkyRenderV1, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SkyRenderV1.git
   cd SkyRenderV1
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
